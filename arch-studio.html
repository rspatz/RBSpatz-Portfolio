          The following projects are challenges from Front-End Mentor, a
          platform that enables you to practice building websites to a design
          and project brief. Each challenge includes mobile and desktop designs
          to show how the website should look at different screen sizes. My job
          was to build out the landing pages and multi-page websites from
          scratch, using all my front-end skills. Creating these projects has
          helped me refine my workflow and solve real-world coding problems.
          Iâ€™ve learned something new with each project, helping me to improve
          and adapt my style.

            <p>
              I recently read an article called "The State of Mobile-First and
              Desktop First" by Ahmad Shadeed (shoutout to Matt Stoddard of
              FrontEnd Mentor for alerting everyone to the article!). Ahmad
              shared a Twitter poll asking how many developers use either, and
              found that the results were mixed: nearly 25% used a mix of both.
              First Ahmad breaks down how a developer uses mobile-first, as
              opposed to desktop-first, the workflow used for each way, then he
              goes on to explain the pros and cons of both.
            </p>

            <p>
              I found it quite interesting that the mobile-first strategy has
              more overrides, and thus more redundant code, than the
              desktop-first. He prefers to use a mix of both, writing the base
              styles first, then showing or hiding certain elements at various
              viewport sizes. He also mentioned CSS specificity issues, which I
              have encountered several times with this and other projects.
            </p>

            <p>
              I find it disconcerting to have the desktop version of a web page
              built out perfectly, only to find a mess after I have finished
              with the mobile version! Ahmad prefers to work on one section or
              element at-a-time in mobile-first, then enhancing for the desktop
              and iPad. I have begun to use a similar strategy for my projects.
              In the future, Ahmad believes that modern and upcoming CSS
              features will render the discussion about mobile-first vs.
              desktop-first moot. CSS-Grid all but dispenses with media queries
              now, and Flexbox also makes laying out elements easier in both
              cases. This article can be found

            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p>
              I am learning more about Flexbox, such as 'align-items: center;'
              which I used to properly align the top navigation button with the
              links. I have since used this to align icons and other elements on
              other FrontEnd Mentor projects that I had been having problems
              with.
