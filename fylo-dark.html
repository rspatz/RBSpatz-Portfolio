    <h2>Fylo Dark-Theme</h2>

    <p>The following projects are challenges from Front-End Mentor, a platform that enables you to practice building websites to a design and project brief. Each challenge includes mobile and desktop designs to show how the website should look at different screen sizes.My job was to build out the landing pages and multi-page websites from scratch, using all my front-end skills. Creating these projects has helped me refine my workflow and solve real-world coding problems. Iâ€™ve learned something new with each project, helping me to improve and adapt my style.</p>

    <h3>Project Background</h3>

    <div class="fylo-project-describe-1">
      <p>This project was built in pure HTML and CSS. I had mobile and desktop designs to 
        work to and built it to be fully-responsive. I took a mobile-first approach 
        and used Sass and Flexbox for layout purposes.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="fylo-project-describe-2">
      <p>This project gave me more practice with Sass and Flexbox, as well as more practice with a Mobile-First strategy. I am becoming quite fast with marking up HTML5 pages, frequently using semantic markup without having to use references, and being able to create different containers and sections on-the-fly. I am also becoming more confident with Flexbox in particular, although I realize I have much more to learn. Finally, I am growing in confidence and understanding as I am revisiting projects that gave me problems months ago and solving multiple problems in a short time.</p>
