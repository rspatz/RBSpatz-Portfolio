    <h2>My Projects</h2>

    <p>The following projects are challenges from Front-End Mentor, a platform that enables you to practice building websites to a design and project brief. Each challenge includes mobile and desktop designs to show how the website should look at different screen sizes.My job was to build out the landing pages and multi-page websites from scratch, using all my front-end skills. Creating these projects has helped me refine my workflow and solve real-world coding problems. Iâ€™ve learned something new with each project, helping me to improve and adapt my style.</p>

        <p>This was one of the first Front-End Mentor landing pages I built. I made it fully responsive and used Flexbox and Sass, as well as mobile-first.</p>

        <p>This project was built in pure HTML and CSS. I had mobile and desktop designs to work to and built it so that it was fully-responsive. I took a mobile-first approach and used Sass with Flexbox for layout purposes.</p>
