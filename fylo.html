          The following projects are challenges from Front-End Mentor, a
          platform that enables you to practice building websites to a design
          and project brief. Each challenge includes mobile and desktop designs
          to show how the website should look at different screen sizes. My job
          was to build out the landing pages and multi-page websites from
          scratch, using all my front-end skills. Creating these projects has
          helped me refine my workflow and solve real-world coding problems.
          Iâ€™ve learned something new with each project, helping me to improve
          and adapt my style.

          <h3>Project Background</h3>
          <div class="fylo-project-describe-1">
            <p>
              This project was built in pure HTML and CSS. I had mobile and
              desktop designs to work to and built it to be fully-responsive. I
              took a mobile-first approach and used Sass and Flexbox for layout
              purposes.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="fylo-project-describe-2">
            <p>
              This project gave me more practice with Sass and Flexbox, as well
              as more practice with a Mobile-First strategy. I am becoming quite
              fast with marking up HTML5 pages, frequently using semantic markup
              without having to use references, and being able to create
              different containers and sections on-the-fly. I am also becoming
              more confident with Flexbox in particular, although I realize I
              have much more to learn. Finally, I am growing in confidence and
              understanding as I am revisiting projects that gave me problems
              months ago and solving multiple problems in a short time.
