    <h2>Clipboard Landing Page</h2>

    <p>The following projects are challenges from Front-End Mentor, a platform that enables you to practice building websites to a design and project brief. Each challenge includes mobile and desktop designs to show how the website should look at different screen sizes.My job was to build out the landing pages and multi-page websites from scratch, using all my front-end skills. Creating these projects has helped me refine my workflow and solve real-world coding problems. Iâ€™ve learned something new with each project, helping me to improve and adapt my style.</p>

    <h3>Project Background</h3>

    <div class="clipboard-project-describe-1">
      <p>This project was built in pure HTML and CSS. I had mobile and desktop designs to 
        work to and built it to be fully-responsive. I took a mobile-first approach 
        and used Sass and Flexbox for layout purposes.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="clipboard-project-describe-2">
      <p>I am continuing to learn more about Flexbox, and I am growing in confidence of my overall Front-End Web Development skills. I am becoming faster writing semantic HTML5, as well as applying styles to each page. Frequently, I can write this code from memory, and my typing speed is becoming quite fast (probably due to my 12 years as a data-entry clerk, among other reasons).</p>
